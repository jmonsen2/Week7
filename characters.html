    <div class="description">
        <p>Jerry is a timid guard that tries his best to do his job. However, he's not very <br>
        very good at it. That's okay, though. A for effort, right?</p>

        <h3>The Alien</h3>

    <div class="description">
        <p>The Alien is a lifeform shrouded in confusion - at least for it's onlookers. <br>
        Rumor has it that it's stolen precious things from people that see it.</p>
    </div>

        <img src="The Alien.png"/>

        <h3>Timbuk the Turtle</h3>

    <div class="description">
        <p>Timbuk the Turtle is a quiet little guy that likes to try and crawl as fast as <br>
        he can, but being a turtle, he doesn't really ever get anywhere. Either way, it's <br>
        best to pretend that Timbuk gets somewhere, or else he gets sad.</p>
